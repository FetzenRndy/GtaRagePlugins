# GTA RagePluginHook Plugins . By Fetzen

This is a collection of plugins I have built for GTA.

#### Suggestions?

If you have a Suggestion please open a issue ticket, I would be more than happy to make a plugin or a feature you want in the Game a reality.

#### Problems?

If you are a "User" of the plugin open a discussion on the mod's page.
Should I not respond to that support-request feel free to open an Issue here.

If you are a Developer feel free to open an Issue.

#### Getting Started Developing

Since the license of the RagePluginHook prohibits the inclusion of the built binary, I can not upload it to github.
This means if you want to get started developing, you need to download and copy the sdk into the `/sdk/` folder.

Instructions to do so can be found in the `/sdk/` folder.

#### Contributions

If you want to contribute feel free to raise issues and make pull requests.
Make sure to follow the instructions above.
