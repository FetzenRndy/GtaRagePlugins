# GTA RagePluginHook Plugins . By Fetzen

Here you have some open source plugins for the Rage Plugin hook.

#### What is this all about ?

I made some basic Rage plugins and decided to open source them all of my plugins can be found at a compiled version at the official LSPDFR website.

#### Suggestions?

If you have a Suggestion please open a issue ticket, I would be more than happy to make a plugin or a feature you want in the Game a reality.

Please open a Issue ticket with the logs of the Game, the used version of the Plugin and if you can a picture of your GTA - lspdfr - Rage and Plugins folder.
