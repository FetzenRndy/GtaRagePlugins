To make the dev-environment work, [download](https://ragepluginhook.net/)
and place the sdk in this folder. In the end it should look like demonstrated below.

The sdk itself can not be included, since the license of the RagePluginHook prohibits it.

```
<project-root>/sdk/
	RagePluginHookSDK.dll
	RagePluginHookSDK.xml
```

The xml file is optional but it includes some helpfull documentation.
