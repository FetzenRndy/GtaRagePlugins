Problems with this Plugin ?

	TroubleShooting:
		
		1: Make sure that the .ini file that comes with this mod does exist and contains valid information. 
		All the valid Keys can be found at : https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.windows.forms.keys(v=vs.110).aspx
		If you use the website you have to use the MemberName as the input.
		And: Only replace the characters after the '='. All charactes shall be without '' or "" quotes! 
		
		For Example:

			[KEYBINDINGS]
			HELP=For Help with the ini file visit : https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.windows.forms.keys(v=vs.110).aspx
			CleaningAndRepairing=None
			Cleaning=Alt
			Repairing=A

		In this Example we set the Clean and Repair key to : None -> Meaning it wont ever be activated.
		The Cleaning Key will be set to the ALT Key.
		The Repairing Key will be set to the A Key.
